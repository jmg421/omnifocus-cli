## üèó Architecture

OFCLI follows a modular architecture designed for reliability and extensibility:

```
ofcli/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/           # CLI command implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ omnifocus_api/      # OmniFocus integration layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai_integration/     # AI service integrations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Shared utilities and helpers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/            # OmniFocus automation plugins
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/             # Comprehensive test suite
```

### Key Design Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: Always sync with authoritative OmniFocus data
- **Fail-Safe Operations**: Comprehensive error handling and data validation
- **Apple-First**: Native integration with Apple ecosystem technologies
- **AI-Enhanced**: Intelligent automation without replacing human judgment

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Export Behavior
```bash
# Force fresh export on every command
export OF_RUNNER_V2=1

# Use alternative export location
export OF_EXPORT_PATH="/custom/path"
```

### Calendar Integration Setup
```bash
# Test EventKit permissions
ofcli calendar-verify

# Configure calendar preferences
ofcli config set-calendar "Work Calendar"
```

### Plugin Development
OFCLI supports custom OmniFocus plugins written in OmniJS:

```javascript
// plugins/custom_automation.omnijs
(() => {
    const action = new PlugIn.Action("Custom Action", (selection) => {
        // Your automation logic here
    });
    return action;
})();
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_commands.py
pytest tests/test_ai_integration.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=ofcli
```

## üí≠ The Story Behind OFCLI

As the founder of [nodes.bio](https://nodes.bio), I wear every hat in the company - CEO, CTO, CFO, you name it. Context switching between strategic thinking and operational execution was killing my productivity.

I'd been living in OmniFocus for years, but I needed something more. I needed AI to help me prioritize the chaos, calendar integration to reality-check my time, and automation to reduce the cognitive load of task management.

So I built OFCLI for myself. It became the backbone of how I run my startup - combining OmniFocus as my trusted system with AI intelligence and Apple ecosystem integration.

**This tool literally runs my life and my company.** I'm sharing it because the OmniFocus community gave me the foundation for effective time management, and this is my way of giving back.
