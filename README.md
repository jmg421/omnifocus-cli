## 🏗 Architecture

OFCLI follows a modular architecture designed for reliability and extensibility:

```
ofcli/
├── commands/           # CLI command implementations
├── omnifocus_api/      # OmniFocus integration layer
├── ai_integration/     # AI service integrations
├── utils/              # Shared utilities and helpers
├── plugins/            # OmniFocus automation plugins
└── tests/             # Comprehensive test suite
```

### Key Design Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: Always sync with authoritative OmniFocus data
- **Fail-Safe Operations**: Comprehensive error handling and data validation
- **Apple-First**: Native integration with Apple ecosystem technologies
- **AI-Enhanced**: Intelligent automation without replacing human judgment

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Export Behavior
```bash
# Force fresh export on every command
export OF_RUNNER_V2=1

# Use alternative export location
export OF_EXPORT_PATH="/custom/path"
```

### Calendar Integration Setup
```bash
# Test EventKit permissions
ofcli calendar-verify

# Configure calendar preferences
ofcli config set-calendar "Work Calendar"
```

### Plugin Development
OFCLI supports custom OmniFocus plugins written in OmniJS:

```javascript
// plugins/custom_automation.omnijs
(() => {
    const action = new PlugIn.Action("Custom Action", (selection) => {
        // Your automation logic here
    });
    return action;
})();
```

## 🧪 Testing
