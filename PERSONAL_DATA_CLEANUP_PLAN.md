## Implementation Strategy

### âœ… Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (COMPLETED)
1. âœ… Fix addresses in `evan_car_repair_updated.py`
2. âœ… Replace hardcoded family names with generic placeholders
3. âœ… Update calendar integration files
4. âœ… Remove company-specific references

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Systematic Cleanup (IN PROGRESS)
1. ðŸ”„ Remove or anonymize financial information
2. ðŸ”„ Remove personal health information
3. ðŸ”„ Create environment variable system for personal data

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Prevention (PLANNED)
1. Add pre-commit hooks to detect personal data
2. Create documentation for handling personal data
3. Implement automated scanning for PII

## Configuration System

Create a `config/personal_data.py` file:
```python
import os

# Family member names (configurable)
FAMILY_MEMBERS = {
    "MEMBER_1": os.getenv("FAMILY_MEMBER_1", "Family Member 1"),
    "MEMBER_2": os.getenv("FAMILY_MEMBER_2", "Family Member 2"),
    # etc.
}

# Calendar names (configurable)
CALENDAR_NAMES = {
    "FAMILY": os.getenv("FAMILY_CALENDAR", "Family"),
    "MEMBER_1": os.getenv("MEMBER_1_CALENDAR", "Family Member 1"),
    # etc.
}

# Addresses (configurable)
ADDRESSES = {
    "HOME": os.getenv("HOME_ADDRESS", "[HOME_ADDRESS]"),
    "WORK": os.getenv("WORK_ADDRESS", "[WORK_ADDRESS]"),
    # etc.
}
```

## Files Requiring Immediate Attention

### âœ… High Priority (COMPLETED)
1. âœ… `commands/evan_car_repair_updated.py` - **COMPLETELY REMOVED**

## Next Steps

2. **âœ… Today**: Implement Phase 1 fixes
3. **ðŸ”„ This Week**: Complete Phase 2 systematic cleanup
4. **ðŸ“‹ Next Week**: Implement Phase 3 prevention measures

## Security Considerations

- All personal data should be moved to environment variables or secure configuration files
- No personal data should be committed to version control
- Add `.env` files to `.gitignore`
- Consider using a secrets management system for production deployments

## Compliance Notes

- This cleanup addresses potential GDPR/privacy violations
- Personal data exposure in open source code is a security risk
- All family member names, addresses, and personal information must be anonymized
- Financial and health information must be completely removed or heavily anonymized
